# **🚀 Churn Prediction System**

## **📌 Project Overview**
Our project focuses on developing a **Churn Prediction System** to identify customers who are likely to leave or stop using a service. With **Machine Learning** models and advanced analytics, businesses can retain customers through targeted interventions and personalized offers. 💼📉

### **🎯 Objective**
Predict customer churn and provide actionable insights for improving retention, using real-world telecom data as an example. We highlight recent issues like **Jio's market downfall** due to service quality and price hikes.

## **📝 Problem Statement**
The churn rate in the **Telecommunication Industry** has been rising, especially due to competitive pricing, service quality issues, and changes in customer behavior. Recently, companies like **Jio** have faced a **downfall** in their customer base due to increased complaints, service quality degradation, and price hikes. The goal is to build a **predictive model** that helps identify **at-risk customers** and reduce churn through targeted retention strategies. 📊📉

## **🛠 Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn 📊
- **Machine Learning Models:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost 🤖
- **Database:** MongoDB 💽
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub 🛠

## **📊 Dataset**
The dataset includes various customer information such as:
- **Customer demographics** (age, gender, location)
- **Subscription details** (plan type, usage, billing)
- **Customer service interactions** (number of complaints, support calls)
- **Churn label** (whether the customer has left the service or not)

### **📁 Data Source:** 
We used an open-source dataset as a proxy for telecom customer behavior. The data was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

## **🔍 Methodology**
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Data was collected and cleaned using Python (Pandas) 🧼, handling missing values and normalizing features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Key insights were derived through visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib) 📊 to understand customer behavior and feature importance.

3. **Model Building**  
   We used **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to train the model on customer data 🤖.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   The models were evaluated using performance metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** 📈.

## **✨ Key Features**
- **Real-Time Churn Prediction**: Input new customer data and get instant churn predictions 🚀.
- **Actionable Insights**: Visualize key features like customer complaints, usage patterns, and billing issues contributing to churn 📊.
- **Dashboard for Monitoring**: A real-time dashboard to track customer churn and model performance 📈.

## **📈 Evaluation**
Our models were evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** 85% ✅
- **Precision:** 80%
- **Recall:** 78%
- **F1 Score:** 79%

We also used a **confusion matrix** to visualize model performance in predicting churn and non-churn cases.

## **🔔 Conclusion**
This **Churn Prediction System** can greatly assist telecom companies in identifying customers who are likely to churn. By taking corrective actions in time, companies can **improve customer retention** and reduce revenue losses 🏆💡.

## **💻 How to Use**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/churn-prediction-system.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the model:**  
   Use the provided **Jupyter Notebook** to load the data, train the model, and make predictions 📊.

## **🚀 Deployment (Optional)**
While we have not deployed the model yet, it can be easily deployed using a REST API framework like **Flask** or **FastAPI**. Containerization using **Docker** 🐳 is recommended to ensure consistency across environments. Cloud hosting options like **AWS** or **Azure** can be used for scalability 🌐.
