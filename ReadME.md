Churn Prediction System
Project Overview
Our project focuses on developing a Churn Prediction System aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave or stop using a service. By leveraging Machine Learning models and advanced analytics, businesses can use this system to retain customers through targeted interventions and personalized offers.

Objective
To predict customer churn and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention. We have used a real-world dataset from the Telecommunication Industry, taking recent issues like Jio's market downfall as an example.

Problem Statement
The churn rate in the Telecommunication Industry has been increasing, especially due to competitive pricing, service quality issues, and changes in customer behavior. Recently, companies like Jio have faced a significant downfall in their customer base due to increased complaints, service quality degradation, and price hikes. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that helps telecom companies identify at-risk customers and reduce churn through targeted retention strategies.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Database: MongoDB
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Dataset
The dataset includes various customer information such as:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
Subscription details (plan type, usage, billing)
Customer service interactions (number of complaints, support calls)
Churn label (whether the customer has left the service or not)
Data Source:
We used an open-source dataset as a proxy for telecom customer behavior. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning
Data was collected and cleaned using Python (Pandas), handling missing values and normalizing features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights were derived through visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to understand customer behavior and feature importance.

Model Building
We used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to train the model on customer data.

Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Key Features
Real-Time Churn Prediction: Input new customer data and get instant churn predictions.
Actionable Insights: Visualize key features like customer complaints, usage patterns, and billing issues contributing to churn.
Dashboard for Monitoring: A real-time dashboard to track customer churn and model performance.
Evaluation
Our models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 80%
Recall: 78%
F1 Score: 79%
We also used a confusion matrix to visualize model performance in predicting churn and non-churn cases.

Conclusion
This Churn Prediction System can greatly assist telecom companies in identifying customers who are likely to churn. By taking corrective actions in time, companies can improve customer retention and reduce revenue losses.

How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/churn-prediction-system.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model:
Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to load the data, train the model, and make predictions.
Deployment (Optional)
While we have not deployed the model yet, it can be easily deployed using a REST API framework like Flask or FastAPI. Containerization using Docker is recommended to ensure consistency across environments. Cloud hosting options like AWS or Azure can be used for scalability.
